"# CarLearning" 

*Work in progress still. Working on improving collision functionality and adding radars to detect other vehicles on track for second run. 

This code was here to attempt to track the number of collisions between cars who have more information avaliable to their vehicles in comparison to less information. This is to hopefully prove the importance of not only just gaining the amount of information within the car, but also when new technology comes out, such as the edge which is what this collision comparison program is based off of in comparison to the cloud, the idea of having more information can be here and proven to help the functionality of AV's. 

Possible direction later could be to have these cars become connected AV's, but only once I complete the parts above.
